## ⚓️ The Motivation

Being an amateur web developer, I've crafted a stunning 2048 game using vanilla TypeScript. My motivation? To spotlight my growing skills, fuse creativity with coding, and share my passion with others. This project reflects my journey, challenges me to solve problems, and showcases my potential in the web development realm.

(I'm lazy to write my own description lol this is generated using ChatGPT but I promise this is my true motivation)

## 💡 Inspirations 

This project has been on my mind since the very beginning of my web development journey, I also made one using Tkinter back in the day but somehow severe procrastination deterred me from starting this until I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYAc7yl2KY8).
